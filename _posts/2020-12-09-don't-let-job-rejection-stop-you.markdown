I'm no exception to the statistics out there regarding job seekers and available entry level positions. It's rough enough without the pandemic, but the extra level of competition brought on by the availability of time and easy transition routes to education seekers has made it even harder. Despite the odds though, I received my first interview.

Those familiar with the process know that a job in tech consists of three separate segments. Part one is typically a phone interview where the company gets to know you and vice versa. Part two is the technical assessment, and as everyone can agree, these suck. Finally, part three is where they get to decide whether to move forward with you as a new employee. It's where you're told your benefits and pay and where you get to breath a sigh of relief because the fight is finally letting up and you can step out into the light you've been scrambling to get to for so long...

Yeah.

So I got an interview, right! Exciting. I haven't graduated yet but I wanted a running start into the job seeking world so I applied with a company I was familiar with. I won't disclose who, they were kind enough to give me a chance. The phone interview went well, of course. I'm cordial and polite and make jokes when appropriate. I moved on to the assessment segment and that's where it stops. If I had gotten the job this would be a completely different post! 

The assessments were a slap in the face to say the least. I was told they would be high level assessments testing a variety of skill sets including Python, SQL, Machine Learning and JavaScript. Skills that not many entry level data analysts fully grasp, and certainly not a standard combination used in entry level positions on a daily basis. Immediately recognizing that sinking feeling in my stomach, I decided it would be best to bite the bullet, get it over with, I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't just knock it out...

and I failed.

###  What Then?
I don't mean to sound incredibly negative, but I knew as soon as I started the assessment that I wasn't going to do well. The test itself was hosted by a site that would attempt to combine all four of the afformentioned skill sets onto a single platform. Where I'm only familiar with a dedicated platform for each language, i.e. Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, PGadmin, etc, the website where I would be inputing code was strange, hard to follow, and the error codes were unfamiliar. Excuses aside, the exam was incredibly out of my league. 

It started off simple enough with a multiple choice segment, but not the fun kind where you pick one answer of four options and move on. Nay nay. These were the "check the boxes that all apply" kind of multiple choice questions. The kind that were definitely spawned to weed out the scrubs like me who can usually skate by with reading comprehension and linguistic root analysis skills. Touche.

The second half of the test consisted of four challenges, one for each desired skillset, and this is where I was absolutely slaughtered. Did I mention this was a timed assessment? I had an hour to rack my brain for solutions to problems that would usually take me an hour each to solve. Were they impossible? No, not at all, but was I prepared for it? Also no, not at all.

### Am I "Handling" It? Yeah, pssht, totally! 
The following afternoon I received the dreaded email no one likes to get, but I can't say I didn't see it coming. The company was nice enough to follow up my poor assessment results with your standard, "we appreciate your interest in <i>XYZ Company</i> but..." and a slew of helpful resources that could assist me with learning the material should I be inclined to apply again in another six months. 

My reaction to the news was somber. I was excited at the prospect of finding a job prior to graduating. My boyfriend had, but his coding program offered job placement guarantees, and mine definitely does not. It's a mad dash to maintain traction, and with the current market it's like trying to run on an ice rink. 

I try not to be bitter, and I'm not saying I let it get to me for long, but it happens. I can't help but compare myself to others when the enviornment around me is so competitive, and I think to some extent everyone does it. My key takeaway from this rejection email has been truly simple though, I need to work <i>smarter</i>. 

### Can't Stop Now
Data analysis as a tool has given me the ability to look at the data available and use it to draw evidence of a hypothesis, which is what's stopping me from remaining stagnant while I mope around feeling sorry for myself. I'm still bummed, but now I'm butthurt and productive. Realizing how poor the assessment went before I even graduate is a positive experience, in a way, because now I know what to expect. 

My bootcamp helped me build a foundation for my portfolio, and it helped me get my feet wet with the languages I would someday need to master, but it also gave me an unrealistic set of expectations which left me vulnerable to dissapointment like the rejection I just experienced has. 

From here on my goals will be oriented around mastering each language and giving them their due time. You know, longer than a week... This company wanted me to know all four languages mentioned at the drop of a hat. Entry level, part time, hourly work that wouldn't even utilize those skills on a daily/monthly basis. I'm grateful for the reality check, but I think my expectations for myself and for the industry have been permanently lowered.

### TLDR: 
    1. Recent bootcamp graduates need to brush up on the basics
    2. Mastering language foundations (ex; syntax) is crucial 
    3. It's not always about constructing and building an app, sometimes it's just a loop.
    4. Be disappointed, it's okay and it's normal, but don't let yourself become stagnant. 
    5. Be realistic. You aren't an engineer or a scientist, you are a bootcamp grad with a cert.
