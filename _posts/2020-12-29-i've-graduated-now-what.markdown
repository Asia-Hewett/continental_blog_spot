### Happy Holidays! Goodbye 2020, and Good Riddance.

In January of this year I was set to live my best Roaring 20's inspired year... then the 'Rona happened and I spent the year in lockdown. I missed out on days at the rivers, evenings at nerd stores with friends playing table top RPG's, and I could no longer go on my weekly hikes or visit my family. It was rough for everyone, but I am happy to say that like many others, I took advantage of the pandemic and did something I'd been meaning to do but never had the time to. I switched careers.

Coding bootcamp was a challenge. It was stressful and it challenged me in so many ways but the takeaway was worth it. I'm able to confidently hold conversations regarding data analytics and can question data I find in a way that makes logical sense. Logic being important because I see a lot of emotionally charged "data", espeically in political circles.

Now that I have my evenings and weekends back though, what do I do? I've seen a lot of graduates take on the "100 Days of Code" challenge, and quite frankly that always seemed pretty silly to me. Why stop at one-hundred? So as I'm thinking about what I want to do, I'm thinking I'll up the ante. I don't just want some <i>job</i> in data, I want a career.

### Projects and Skills I'd Like to Work On

I've done a bit of searching when trying to narrow down my desired career positions and I've found that my favorite companies are all looking for the same skills. As far as languages go, they're looking for:

  1. R, for statistical programming
  2. Python, for scripting
  3. SQL, for building relational databases
  4. BI tools for business intelligence analysis (Microsoft Power BI)
  5. Machine Learning packages like RapidMiner

To be honest some of these are interchangable with some other tools or skills but these are the ones I'm going to focus on for the next year. I might find a job in data, and I might be fortunate enough to have my lack of a Bachelors degree overlooked, but the goal for now is to get a job literally anywhere, and the field doesn't matter, because I have bills to pay and we're moving soon! Exciting stuff, but my goal to make something of myself from this experience is still going strong.

### Where to Start?

I've been so overwhelmed by the reality check that I received a couple of weeks ago after bombing my first interview, and I'm not ashamed to share this! Other people in my position may be considering switching careers and may be wanting to go into data analytics as well, but before you get sold on an idea, you should know a couple of things. 

One, that bachelors degree does matter. Whoever says it doesn't is lying to you. If you don't have a BA or another fancy name to put on your resume (i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) your resume will likely be thrown out and you'll get ghosted A LOT. It's okay though, it's not the end all be all, it just means it will take you that much longer to find a job and it won't be a sexy one when you do. 

Two, statistics in bootcamps are seriously underplayed. Spend some time really committing to learning statistics like you would if you were actually working on a BA in mathematics or something. This will not only boost your confidence when being interviewed on complicated concepts like Machine Learning, but it will make learning R and ML easier as well. 

Thirdly, and lastly because I don't want to seem overly negative, DO NOT think that once you receive your cert you are done. After you finish bootcamp the average amount of time spent looking for a job is between six months to a year. This is entirely dependent on you as a person and how ambitious you might be or how personable you are during an interview, but the takeaway is that you're not done. The market is extremely competitive, someone is always more qualified than you are, especially on paper, and it will not be easy juggling job searching with your current job while you study on the side and prep for potential interviews, but it can be done!

### TLDR: 
    1. Your bootcamp cert is step one and it's just the beginning
    2. After graduating you can expect to devote just as much time to job hunting
    3. Use your dream job postings to help narrow down which skills to hone in on and then master them
    4. Never forget to balance your expectations and don't overwhelm yourself
    5. Don't give up. Exit the echochamber of people being negative. You've got this!
