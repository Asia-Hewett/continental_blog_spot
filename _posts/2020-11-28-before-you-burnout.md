If there's one thing I've learned about myself since starting bootcamp, it's that I had an unhealthy relationship with failure. Like with many people, failure for me was something I never learned to cope with. I was so used to taking paths that I knew I could succeed in venturing down that when it came to learning how to code, something new, something completely off the beaten path... I failed a lot! 
 
You could say I was used to succeeding or perhaps that I'd been spoiled with good luck, but here I was with twenty-four classmates in the same boat as I was but it seemed like I was the only one struggling to stay afloat. With the added loneliness brought on by Covid, perhaps I wasn't, but failure is not something people openly talk about so how was I to know? Early on in our courses this internal struggle hit me hard. I was filled to the brim with self doubt I had never experienced before. Could I do this? Was I stupid? Why am I the only one not getting this? Did I just invest twelve-thousand dollars and six months of my life for something I would never see a return on? 
 
God, the questions I asked myself were just as bad as the stress I was experiencing. Every class session came with another round of anxieties and added to the mountain of worries. When I confronted my student success manager about the difficulties I was facing, I was told this was a purposeful tactic the company preferred to use for their Bootcamp curriculum. Why!? Surely the amount of stress I was experiencing was detrimental, and this was the farthest I'd ever been from a healthy learning environment. I cracked. If this was considered ideal, then there was no way I was going to make it in the real world. 
 
Thankfully, I'm a loud mouth and I complain a lot. 
 
I took my woes to Reddit, and shared my anxieties with my coding community. This is where I truly learned what the world of tech would be like once I claimed victory over this curriculumn. I racked up hundreds of responses from college graduates, bootcamp alumni, and senior developers from various backgrounds, each of whom assured me that the world of code was not as toxic as my bootcamp was making it out to be. I wasn't coddled by any means, many people warned of the dangers of becoming content, of being left behind, losing your job to complacency, and urged me to never lose my commitment to self growth. However, the biggest take away was this -- Self care is crucial. 
 
### Routine, Exercise, and Small Goals
 
The long standing stigma surrounding a future desk jockey like myself would be that the combination of sedentary work life and hours of computer posture would leave me deprived of Vitamin D, hobbies, and a robust social life. True to form, some reddit bound developers suffering from their own varieties of burn out confessed their poor abilities to commit to themselves more than their nine-to-five, but others were encouraged by those companies to <i>make the time</i> whether it be by cutting the work week to four days on, three days off, or by incentivising employees with monetary rewards for watching their calories and counting their steps.
 
Loads of people shared their strategies in regards to how they cope with stress and how unorthodox things like therapies and routines brought balance back into their lives during their chaotic transition to tech. Some examples I clung to without realizing I was even missing them were heavy on the routine side. I realized how much I lacked routine! After spending the past seven years working for myself, making my own hours, going where the wind took me and constantly racing to make deadlines... I had NO routine. 
 
I started with the basics. When to wake up, when to go to sleep, the sort of things a Covid lifestyle stripped of most people and the kind of thing my bootcamp made more difficult. You see our class hours were 6P.M. to 10P.M. and sometimes later for tough assignments and projects, so bed by 10:30P.M. became the goal. Small victories people. Having that routine in place made it easier to know when quitting time was. Sure this transition would be life changing, and it was essentially my job for the six month duration to become an epic programmer, to stand out amongst the crowds and hoards of other people vying for the same jobs, but what good am I without sleep?
 
The next steps would be exercise and personal care. Yes Covid has made stretchy pants and not brushing your teeth socially acceptable, but one day the veil will lift and your dentist will be disappointed. More small changes added a sense of self back into my morning routines. My bathroom time more than doubled, but I started to regain some self confidence I didn't expect to help so much. Look good, feel good! <i>*awkward finger guns*</i>
 
### Yoga(na) Thank Me Later.

I can't say I've never been the type to meditate. In high school I was a well rounded teenager who woke up with enough energy to power the planet. How? Two hours of exercise a day and thirty minutes of yoga before bed. That's how, and probably the added benefit of having the metabolism of a hummingbird. What could it hurt though? I'd gotten so accustomed to being outside of my comfort zone that perhaps that's just what I needed. More discomfort!

So I've gotten back into yoga as a means of coping with the stress this transitional time in my life brings up. Fitbit even rolled out a feature for tracking your time spent meditating every day, so I'm using that and saving the data to use for a future personal project. I think it'd be really cool to duplicate a fitbit dashboard but make it interactive so I can see my progress, or lack there of, since the lockdowns started! 
 
The key to not burning out though... I don't know. Maybe I peaked. Maybe those reddit peeps were just <i>that</i> relatable. Something clicked though and things got easier. Not right away, of course not, but I backed away from the edge of a dangerous cliff and gave myself a chance to breath. I've made taking breaks, actual breaks, vacations and weekends an important part of my self care routine. Visiting friends and talking to family saved me. Structuring my routine and organizing my study, work, family and exercise routines all gave me the boost of confidence and support my mental health needed. I'm still obsessed with GitHub commits, and still addicted to learning and improving my programming skills, but it's not an anxiety induced grind anymore. Now I can actually enjoy it and I'm not just scrambling to find what works. The best takeaway though is the confidence to share that experience with my classmates going through the same thing. I'm not worried about their judgment, just worried they think they're alone when we're all running the same marathon. I'm also not as worried about graduating top of my class anymore. No matter where I stand, I'm still coming out of this bootcamp net positive.

I know failure is hard to talk about, and burnout culture has only been amplified by Covid-19, but if you're going through the same thing, or you're at the end of your own rope, find me on LinkedIn and shoot me a message. And as always, constructive criticism is very welcome, you can't hurt my feelings so be honest. Much appreciated, can't wait to hear from you!</i>
