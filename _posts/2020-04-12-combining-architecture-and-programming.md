In an earlier post I wrote that some of my passions included architecture and construction. Since then I've sat down with my boyfriend and had many conversations revolving around the prospects of buying a house, one that required some renovations, in the near future wherein he posed the question, "would that really be your dream job?" Understandable considering I just signed up to sit at a desk for eight hours a day. I figure now would be a great time to explain how I see my passions intertwining some day to make my childhood dreams a reality!

I previously mentioned using my bootcamp certification as a stepping stone for a foundation in architecture. How? Well, to make it make sense I had to do some research on how rendering 3D models for interior and exterior renovations work, and what construction consultation firms are expected to provide to potential builders. Obviously, fifteen years ago when I was wondering how I'd become an architect, I wasn't thinking I'd be drawing out entire buildings on a computer and bring them to life with virtual walkthroughs, but that's sort of the selling point of a project consultant nowadays! 

Anyone who has gone through a renovation knows that there are often unexpected and unforseen expenses behind drywall and under old shingles, but wouldn't it be convenient to be able to access cost averages of similar projects before you start knocking holes into things? What if you could bid on a for-auction home, tablet in hand, and input any and all potential renovation costs on site with confidence, knowing you'd come out in the green?

I for one am always aggravated at the lack of transparency in cost estimates for a project. I've done a few renovations myself, as a construction savvy nerd, simply because I'd gone through the "quotes" process only to throw my hands up in defeat as bid after bid came in for my project with no actual determinant for outcome. If you've been through something similar, wouldn't having numbers to compare project expenses to have helped you in finding a crew to get the job done?

Now consider the scalability of these projects. As independent contractors back in the day my parents would have to bid on property preservation assignments, and I'd find myself being shoved through the window of a vacant forclosure under cloak of midnight to try and get a leg up on other bidders. Could you imagine trusting the word of a twelve year old? A program with years worth of accumulated data would not only be legal, it'd be user friendly! Droves of contractors could access this data and essentially plug and play their way through competitive markets. Did you know Home Depos sales sky rocketted during the pandemic? What if those same companies could offer their customers a calculator of sorts to get accurate estimates for their projects without having to input their email and spend hours jumping through hoops to avoid talking to a sales person. Those people are obviously going to DIY the project anyway, just cut out the middle man and arm them with the tools to do it successfully. Let the IKEA approach be an option.

So, what gets me excited about code isn't exactly typical. I'm not looking at Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Apple for a job. What helps get me out of bed is the prospect of some day building a tool everyone can use to bring their dreams to life. You want a three bedroom, two bathroom bungalow with a shabby chic kitchen, industrial shelves, granite countertops and soft close drawers? Input your square footage, here's a 3D model you can use, drag and drop your shopping cart items into place, we'll use estimates from similar projects to give you an idea of how much this project will cost you, and if you truly need help, here's a print out that you can take to Home Depot, Lowes, etc and they will walk you through it. THAT, would be amazing. 

I realize right now that Home Depot has something that's like 90% similar to what I just described, but again, I hate jumping through hoops to get my estimates. This program would scale across all projects. Interior <i>and</i> exterior. Large scale construction, small spaces, entire gut jobs if necessary. Plumbing and electrical. New roofs and landscaping. If you have a vision, this would help you realize it, and either your DIY skills or paid contractors with competitive prices would bring it to life.

<i>Hey reader, thanks for sticking through and reading my weird posts. This is my way of attempting to connect with other people transitioning into the world of tech from non-technical background. My background as an English major, partnered with my nearly ten years of experience in insurance, don't exactly make for a sexy computer engineering resume, but I'm working on it! My advice to anyone transitioning from one field to another unrelated field would be to follow your passions and find a way to make them work together. It might not happen right away, but you've got to learn to walk before you run, so appreciate the baby steps and learn from your failures with grace and patience. As always, constructive criticism is always welcome and if you just want to chat, find me on LinkedIn and shoot me a message!</i>
