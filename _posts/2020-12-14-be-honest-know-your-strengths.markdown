description: Job hunting is hard, and it's tempting to fire blindly hoping to hit any target and land a position in the field you want, but sometimes it's best to line your sights, breath, and keep your aim steady. # Add post description (optional)

When I started coding I was so unsure of myself. I would have breakdowns trying to identify where I could best apply my outdated learning methods. Anyone starting out could likely be experiencing the same thing. You can't "study" per say. Coding is best learned through trial and error, by recognizing failure and proceeding to train yourself off of it. It's a lot to take in when you're new, and even harder to specialize in when you're job hunting.

Now that I find myself unemployed and actively seeking entry level roles, I take many precautions to distinguish myself from the other job seekers that don't seem to acknowledge the do's and do-not's of networking. Those LinkedIn profiles that slap all their coding languages and preferred job titles in their headline, separated by a slew of bars that don't do anything to separate their frenzied pursuit from the veneer of professionalism. 

As awkward as I find all the similarities between graduate LinkedIn portfolios, I appreciate the learning opportunities they've provided me. I know what <i>not</i> to do, and I know what a good profile should look like. No offense to people who may not know any better, but I also tend to see these profile owners posting the same messages to their LinkedIn communities; 

"Please help me find a job, I've submit hundreds of applications and haven't heard anything back."

All I can think about though is how different we all are and how those differences tweak our job hunting strategies. I won't stand on my lecturn and denouce the "fire from the hip" method of applying for jobs. I'm with the crowd of people hearing CEO's telling us not to do that, but wondering if they only say that to stop us from taking their jobs.  

However, I started seeing results when I stopped firing blindly and focused on what I wanted. 

Recently, I received a message from a recruiter for a company looking to hire a jr python software engineer. As desperate as I am for a job, I knew this position wasn't for me. I knew I wouldn't be a good fit, and that it'd be a shame of me to waste not only my time, but the companies time as well should I be selected for an interview. I cordially refused the invitation and wished the recruiter good luck finding a better suited candidate, and then took a moment to reflect on the preferred positions I am interested in.

I knew my strength wouldn't be in the languages they were looking for. I haven't ever used Django, and though I have experience with similar framework technologies, I didn't want to chance going off course to learn a language I may never need. Call it a weakness, but I see it as a comfortable reminder to not exceed my personal limitations. If you think limiting myself sounds like a bad thing, I think you're wrong, and I'll tell you why.

# Food For Thought
You will never be a master at everything, so why put yourself through that kind of stress? When I got into Data Science, I saw myself in a research oriented role making sense of data so business decisions could have influential impacts on consumers, the company, and the economy. Being able to relay technical concepts to non-technical people would be an awesome way to combine my love of language with my fondness for analysis. Those ideas are what motivate me and center me when job hunting, and taking a role outside of that description would feel like a desperate grab at something resembling opportunity.

No thank you.

A characteristic people acquire when learning to code is becoming comfortable with discomfort. This makes sense when learning, but should it stay true for the rest of your professional career? Think about that when you're considering the company you'll be commuting to, where most of your waking hours will be spent, who you're leaving your family for every morning. Personally, I'm looking for a career that I <i>want</i>. Not one that satisfies a temporary need like getting my foot in the door.

### TLDR: 
    1. Recent bootcamp graduate profiles and portfolios all look the same
    2. You will never be a master at everything  
    3. Having clear and concise ideals are worth sticking to
    4. Be specific, be honest with yourself, acknowledge your limitations 
    5. Being realistic is not a weakness, it is healthy and your future self will thank you
