## Hey there
If you had told me three years ago that I'd be pursuing a career in tech, I'd <i>one hundred percent</i> absolutely believe you. I was twenty-three years old (1994, baby!), thought I knew everything, was strong, independent, and addamantly against settling, but also completely lost. After three years in community college I'd walked in to my counselors office and asked what I could leave with in two months. She slapped me with an A.A. in English and after I got it in the mail I hung it up because I was proud I didn't need it. 

Now I'm looking at it in my office wondering whether I should go get my bachelors... like that's going to change my luck or something.

You see three years ago I was going to school to "get that piece of paper" because everyone was telling me it was this life changing thing that would set me up for success. Most people saying it had degrees themselves. I however, skated by in school with a B+ and wouldn't say I excelled at anything except working hard. I was a mule for long days, and after jumping the gun and starting my own business at seventeen, I was set up for the forseeable future! At eighteen I had thousands in savings, had a car I'd paid for, bills I could manage, my nails and hair were always done and I went shopping every week. I had money, what would I need papers with fancy crests on them for if I'd already made bank? 

Are you laughing yet? I am, actually! It's hilarious now that I'm twenty-six. I quit that career after seven years and took the remaining bits and pieces of my soul to seek better, more forgiving opportunities. Ones that didn't require working eighty hours a week, weekends, holidays... Ones that would perhaps have an employee insurance plan, dental, and, fingers crossed, sick leave. 

## Complete 180
After seven years of using my early twenties vigor to devote myself to work, I'd torn myself a new one. I flew all over the country living out of my car for weeks at a time to avoid long commutes, steep hotel expenses, and sometimes just to park closer to destinations I needed to get to before a deadline. I wasn't a trucker, fortunately they have a union and mandatory breaks, I was just a girl on the road doing her job, which was often dangerous and unpredictable, and no company was there to back me up, keep me safe, mark my wherabouts or check in on my arrivals. My job was just to get it done. If you're wondering, I was in insurance. 

Am I exaggurating? No. I ran on caffeine and showered at Planet Fitness. I worked ten hours a day and then another four in the evenings. I made seven thousand dollars a month, and spent two thousand a month on my travel expenses. High life? Maybe to a kid who doesn't know any better, but it wasn't the Instagram experience I was hoping for at the time. When I stopped being able to make time for the luxuries in life I wanted, I realized I'd need to change... everything. All I'd known was insurance. See where I'm going with this?

I started seeking opportunities that would allow me the luxuries I was use to, as well as implement my skills I'd picked up as a contractor. I was looking for "transferable skills" like some 1950's housewife looking for her first job. What could I tell people? I'd been alone for seven years! I didn't have colleagues or... bosses! I had emails and voicemails as the sole form of contact with the companies I'd worked for. Even our trainings were done online. I rarely met another insurance inspector in the field, and when I did I was offended because someone else was working in my area. Like they were going to poach my work or something... It was a very competitive and niche market... 

All that aside, I managed to get a referral from a friend and was hired on as a financial representative. I was excited to help people do what I was doing! Investing in their future. Building plans to help them achieve those long term goals we all fantasized about. Setting them up to be prepared for worst case scenarios. I thought I'd love it, but after a year I was sick of it. It was so dog eat dog and everyone was so... <i>fake</i>. I wanted to TRULY make a difference.

So I started thinking back on my passions y'know? What did I really want to do? What did I love?

* Architecture 
* Construction
* Being outdoors
* Research

What an odd combination of things, right?! By this point I'm 24, I'm sitting on thousands of dollars of debt... being a representative you literally don't make a dime unless you sell someone life insurance (I'm not a sales person), so naturally I'm like, "I'm screwed"! There's no way I'm going to land a job as a construction worker or something, and HGTV isn't looking for some no experience scrub to throw in one of their series. I even considered becoming a park ranger! Which I'd love to do actually but maybe when I retire... Then it happened.

My boyfriend had just finished his contract with the Army and had transitioned into the tech industry as a full stack web developer. Top of his bootcamp class he was clearly going places and landed a job before he even graduated. I was intrigued by the potential, but building apps in front of a computer all day didn't sound like my kind of gig, so I started digging around, and thus discovered Data Analytics. Ooooohhhhh, BOY! This was perfect! It was just what the doctor ordered! I could build a foundation for myself with the training a bootcamp could offer me. Get my feet wet with languages like Python and JavaScript. Learn webscraping so I could find data to build projects off of. What luck! And best yet, my life had direction again. I could see the building blocks falling into place as I enrolled at UTSA to begin my journey. First a cert, then my bachelors, and if I could get some experience working at Zillow/Trulia or even Lowes or Home Depot, I'd be lined up to build my own consulting firm in the future! 

The excitement of having found a path I was truly proud to be on was overwhelming. Soon I'll graduate and have something else to frame and hang up in my office, but this time I won't joke about how useless it is, or make fun of myself for just taking the easy way out. Nah. This is what I needed, and I'm going to go far with it.
