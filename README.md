### Welcome to My GitHub! I'm Asia,

I joined the coding community purely out of social pressure and ended up falling in love. My friends and family were all nerds finding their passions in lines of gibberish, and since my passion obviously wasn't in insurance, I took a chance and enrolled at University to find my way. 
<br>
<br>
AND. I. DID. 
<br>
<br>
Web development quickly turned into a creative outlet, and Data Analysis empowered my curiosities when conducting research. I now know that the fundamentals I've absorbed from my classes and lessons will lay the foundation for the incredible business image I hope to create in the future. 

## Motivation: What Keeps Me Going?

:seedling: Constantly aiming to improve myself
<br>
:earth_asia: Learning new things and meeting new people
<br>
:green_heart: I want to improve my community for my family, friends, and neighbors 

## Work Ethic, Work Life, Work Balance

When I set my mind to something I get it done no matter how daunting the task may be. I have experience working as an independent contractor, which makes me effective when completing tasks solo, but I never hesitate to ask for help when my lone-soldier methods need reinforcements. I see my work as a reflection of myself, so I always add a touch of personality to the material given while maintaining my professional composure, but I think the world could use a little more humor and compassion, especially in the work place.
